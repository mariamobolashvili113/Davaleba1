            <h1>Web Development</h1>
            <p>
                <mark>Web development</mark> is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to <ins>complex web-based Internet applications</ins>, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development. Among web professionals, "web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building websites: writing markup and coding. Web development may use different techniques and technologies, such as <del>the old HTML 4</del> <b>the new HTML 5</b>, and includes areas like <strong style="color: blue;">Front-end</strong> and <em>Back-end</em> development. The concept of Web 3.0 is often compared to Web 2.0. For example, some say Web 3.0 offers 2<sup>3</sup> features, while Web 2.0 offers only 2<sub>2</sub> features.

            <h2>Evolution of the World Wide Web and Web Development</h2>
            <h3>Origin/Web 1.0</h3>
            <p>
                <mark>Web 1.0</mark> refers to the first stage of the World Wide Web's evolution, often characterized by static websites where content was primarily served from the server's file system. Users were largely passive consumers of content, hence the term <del>read-only</del> <ins>read-mostly web</ins>. Technologies like <b>CGI</b> and early scripting languages were used for interactivity. The typical user experience was defined by <strong style="color: green;">unidirectional flow</strong> of information. An early example was Tim Berners-Lee's <ins>WorldWideWeb</ins> browser in 1990. Imagine a file size of 2<sup>10</sup> KB, which is much smaller than today's 2<sup>30</sup> KB files.
            </p>
            <h3>Web 2.0</h3> 
            <p>
                <mark>Web 2.0</mark> describes the second stage of the Internet's evolution, focusing on **user-generated content**, **usability**, and **interoperability**. It emphasized the "network as platform" concept, enabling social interaction, collaboration, and content sharing among users. Examples include social networking sites, blogs, and wikis. This shift made users not just consumers but <del>passive</del> <ins>active contributors</ins>. The core technologies enabling this were <b>AJAX</b>, <em>JavaScript frameworks</em>, and more robust server-side scripting. This stage saw a massive increase in the user base, perhaps up to 10<sup>6</sup> users, compared to the 10<sup>3</sup> users of Web 1.0.
            </p>
            <h3>Web 3.0</h3>
            <p>
                <mark>Web 3.0</mark> (sometimes called the Semantic Web or the Decentralized Web) is the emerging third generation of the Internet, where **data is interconnected** in a decentralized way to provide a <del>more basic</del> <ins>more intelligent and autonomous</ins> user experience. Key concepts include **blockchain technology**, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML), aiming to create a **trustless and permissionless** network. Users are expected to have greater control over their data and identity. Developers are focusing on <strong style="color: purple;">decentralized applications (dApps)</strong>. Imagine a complex cryptographic key like $A_{3x}$ versus a simple key $A_{2x}$, where $x$ represents the encryption level.
